# Kanawa Alfarezel Banyu Ramlan — Portfolio

Static site. Six self-contained HTML pages, no build step needed to deploy, no network dependencies.

    index.html        Home
    about.html        About
    work.html         Work (6 projects, filterable)
    services.html     Services
    skills.html       Skills
    case-study.html   Case study template

## 3D layer

Every page carries a small WebGL renderer (k3d.js, bundled inside the page) that draws
the glossy 3D objects: the hero toys, the studio shots, the lifted project covers and the
contact bubbles. Objects follow the cursor, spin faster on hover and bounce when clicked.
On devices without WebGL, or with "reduce motion" switched on, the page falls back to the
original flat design or a still 3D frame.

## Deploy on GitHub Pages

1. Create a repository and upload every file in this folder to the root.
2. Settings → Pages → Source: `Deploy from a branch` → Branch: `main` / `/ (root)`.
3. The site is live at `https://<username>.github.io/<repo>/`.

For a personal domain, name the repository `<username>.github.io`.

## Deploy elsewhere

Netlify Drop or Vercel: drag this folder onto the upload area. No settings needed.

## Editing

The pages here are built from `source/` in the project folder:

    source/pages/<page>.html   page markup, CSS and page scripts
    source/k3d.js              the 3D renderer and every 3D scene
    source/build.py            rebuilds these six files: python source/build.py
